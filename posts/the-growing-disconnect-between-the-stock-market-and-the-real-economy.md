As the world continues to struggle with the Covid-19 pandemic, the rapid spread of the infection, the mounting death toll and economic destruction have brought many countries to the brink. Yet, financial markets worldwide seem to exist in a parallel universe, having recovered from the massive losses in March to enter a fresh bull market.

There are no shortage of expert opinions on why there is a growing divergence between the financial markets and the real world. Some aspects of this curious phenomenon can be explained by the accommodative monetary policies of the Central Banks and the generous fiscal stimulus packages put up by Governments caught flat-footed by the Covid-19 virus outbreak. 

### Central Bank Monetary Policies

As the crisis unfolded, Central Banks around the world responded in a timely manner to support the financial markets and to mitigate the damage to the real economy.

  * Central Banks instituted policy rate cuts to reduce the cost of borrowing and to stimulate economic activity.

  * Central Banks provided ample liquidity support to the distressed financial markets.

  * Central Banks stepped in to purchase financial assets such as government bonds and corporate debt to keep the financial markets functioning.

### Government Fiscal Policies

Governments around the world have implemented massive fiscal stimulus packages to stem job losses and to arrest the rapid decline of the real economy. Examples of these packages include payroll/job support schemes, soft loans to SMEs, debt moratorium and direct cash handouts. Many governments expect to incur substantial budget deficits this year because of these fiscal policies.

### Financial Markets are forward looking

Financial markets have the uncanny ability to look beyond the present crisis, to anticipate the eventual economic recovery down the road. At this point the Global Stock Markets, rightly or wrongly, are pricing in a V-shaped recovery in the real economy.

### It's a liquidity driven rally

With so much liquidity being pumped into the financial markets through the concerted efforts of the Global Central Banks, it is simply inevitable that stock markets reverse their downward trend and quickly begin to climb upwards, just like a balloon will simply expand continuously as long as air is being blown into it. As the markets begin to rise, asset managers, whose performance are benchmarked against the stock indices, are compelled to participate in the rally for fear of missing out (FOMO).

### Money has no value these days

As part of the Central Bank monetary policies, the price of money has been driven to nearly zero or even negative in certain parts of the world. Low interest rates play a significant role in inflating asset prices as it increases the present value of future cash flows.

### In conclusion - Where do we go from here?

It is now increasingly clear that the stock market has taken a life of its own and has diverged from current economic realities. The reasons for optimism are justifiable in that the unprecedented Central Bank monetary policies and Government fiscal stimulus packages have so far proven to be effective in mitigating the short-term economic damage from the Covid-19 pandemic.

Markets are also optimistic that the scientific and medical community will eventually develop a viable drug treatment or an effective vaccine for this disease, allowing the resumption of work, business and commercial activities which will lead to the much-needed restoration of Global economic growth.

There is no doubt that market participants are pricing in a V-shaped recovery and have been emboldened by the valiant efforts of the Central Banks and Governments around the world to backstop the Global economy from further deterioration. But what if the much anticipated economic recovery is not V-shaped but turns out to be U-shaped or even L-shaped? Investors have been proven to be overly optimistic many times in the past, and in such events the stock markets will inevitably experience a downward correction.

So what can we do at this point in time? There are probably two reasonable choices for the prudent investor:

1. The conservative investor would probably hold on to cash and live to fight another day. The downside to this approach is that one would have to watch in envy as other investors reap their profits in the rising markets.

2. Alternatively, the more aggressive investors would choose to hold on to the ride and enjoy the rewards of a liquidity driven market rally. One would be well advised to employ the tools of technical analysis to watch closely for trend reversals and set tight stop loss orders to protect the hard-earned gains.

In any case, investors would do well to remember the important principle of ***"Caveat Emptor"***.
